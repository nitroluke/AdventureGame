Overview
    The team at first struggled to keep files in sync because the various IDE's
sometimes used tabs instead of spaces, making for incredibly tidious merge
conflicts. Part of the persistence issues was a bug in which one group
member's Eclipse IDE always inserted tabs for spaces even when the
configurations were set properly and identical to each other. This was not a
problem of the members but a bug of the program. In the future, use of Eclipse
is discouraged. NetBeans is the proposed alternative, which works properly on
every member's computers.
    This was the only hurdle. Dividing the work up was the next process. It was
decided that the work for scale and negate should be paired because negate
depends on scale's functionality. It was also decided that add and subtract
should be grouped together due to being essentially the same methods spare the
change to the operator. Dot and magnitude were divided up separately, and
overview as well as equality were handled on it own.


Contributions of each member:
    Todd Beckman initialized the assignment package and prepared the project 
to fitthe format specified by the instructions by making empty files where they were needed. Then, he implemented the first test case (testEqual) and then
implemented a working equal check in Vector3D.
    Kalvyn Lu wrote the test case for the scale method and then implemented it.
He then wrote the test case for the negate method and implemented it.
    Luke Welna fixed the spacing problem, formatted the code properly and added tests for addition and subtraction.
