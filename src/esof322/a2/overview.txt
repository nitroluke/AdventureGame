Overall Description of Changes
------------------------------
    The provided code was an collosal nightmare of spaces and tabs. The very
first change was to make all of the code fit a uniform format (4 space indent
and no tabs). This is the agreed-upon format that the group decided to use at
the start of the semester.
    The next change was to pull out the game's listener code into a separate
method so that it could later be modified to behave differently without
affecting the gameplay.
    A new InputListener class was made to interface between objects. The
caller to receive() waits for the caller of send(String message). The test of
this class was the button presses, which calls the model, which in turn sends
the appropriate character to the game. This communication system works in
both directions, so the game is also capable of sending messages with the model
on the receiving end.
    In order to assure that the InputListener functions properly, it must be
initialized and linked to both the game and the model before runtime. Thus,
the view invokes the model's startQuest method (which then invokes the game's)
AFTER initialization of both game and model are finished.
    The model had no way of knowing the current player's inventory and location.
In order to display the player's inventory, the Player variable is now global. The
corresponding getter method was also implemented. The previous implementation of the
GUI did not allow user input. This became a problem when the player wanted to grab or
drop an item and needed to choose which item to grab or drop. A text box was 
implemented to fix this. The player can now input a string into the text box
and submit it to the model.
    The model now includes an instance of AdventureGameView. This way the view can be
edited directly from the model.
