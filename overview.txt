Overview
    The team at first struggled to keep files in sync because the various IDE's
sometimes used tabs instead of spaces, making for incredibly tedious merge
conflicts. Part of the persistence issues was a bug in which one group
member's Eclipse IDE always inserted tabs for spaces even when the
configurations were set properly and identical to each other. This was not a
problem of the members but a bug of the program. In the future, use of Eclipse
is discouraged. NetBeans is the proposed alternative, which works properly on
every member's computers.
    This was the only hurdle. Dividing the work up was the next process.
Setting up the project was paired with writing the equality method due to being
pivotal to testing the rest of the project. It was decided that the work for
scale and negate should be paired because negate depends on scale's
functionality. It was also decided that add and subtract should be grouped
together due to being essentially the same methods spare the change to the
operator. Dot and magnitude were divided up separately.


Contributions of each member:

    Todd Beckman initialized the assignment package and prepared the project
to fit the format specified by the instructions by making empty files where
they were needed. Then, he implemented the first test case (testEqual) and then
implemented a working equal check in Vector3D. He spent 5 minutes coding but
almost 2 hours configuring the folders to match the sub-standard specifications.

    Kalvyn Lu wrote the test case for the scale method and then implemented it.
He then wrote the test case for the negate method and implemented it.

    Luke Welna fixed the spacing problem, formatted the code properly
and added tests for addition and subtraction.

    Dylan Hills wrote the test method and the implementation of the magnitude method.
